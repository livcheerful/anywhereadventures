Cheyenne, a budding new town in the 1870s, was a “treeless prairie town surrounded by large ranches”. Very few trees grow natively to the high prairie -- one of them being the heart-leafed cottonwood. However, encouraging growth of trees benefits the entire ecosystem. The coverage protects animals from cutting winds, and with roots in the ground, water would soak into the ground instead of flooding over and destroying the landscape.

To find what other plants could survive the harsh climate, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established the Cheyenne Horticultural Field Station. They explored all different kinds of plants, including trees, shrubs, fruits, vegetables, and of course, flowers. The USDA gathered samples from around the world that might have similar conditions, like northern China and Russia.

The Field Station was built by workers in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which was a program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression to put unemployed men to work around the country.

The figure is smiling, and the CCC logo is in the top left of the poster. The top of the poster reads A YOUNG MAN’S OPPORTUNITY."/>

The CCC worked to address a range of issues, including (but definitely not limited to):

The CCC was also involved in many other projects across Wyoming: 
- Removing hazardous submerged trees from Jackson Lake. The trees were submerged when Jackson Lake expanded due to damming. 
- Fighting fires in Campbell County caused by lightning, which had been burning for years.
- Building various structures at Guernsey State Park, including the castle, latrine, museum, dock, and drinking fountains, many of which are still used by park visitors today.

The buildings were designed by William Dubois, a successful Wyoming architect who has fourteen buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.

And one of their miscellaneous projects was building the new “Central Great Plains Field Station” located just outside of Cheyenne. Once built, the Field Station tackled the problem of finding hardy variety of a strawberry plant. After gathering 42,000 plants ranging from New Mexico to Montana, three new strawberry varieties were released: the Radiance, Ogallala, and Fort Laramie.

In 1974, the focus of the Field Station shifted to focus on grasslands and things like what grazing patterns are best, a very applicable study for the area. And now, the trees and shrubs that managed to survive under minimal care are the strongest of the bunch - they thrived independently in Cheyenne’s harsh climate.
