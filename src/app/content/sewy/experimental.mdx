Cheyenne, a budding new town in the 1870s, was a “treeless prairie town surrounded by large ranches”. Very few trees grow natively to the high prairie -- one of them being the heart-leafed cottonwood. However, encouraging growth of plants is good. The coverage protects animals from cutting winds, and with roots in the ground, water would soak up instead of flooding over and destroying the landscape.

To find what other plants could survive the harsh climate, the US Department of Agriculture established the Cheyenne Horticultural Field Station. They explored all different kinds of plants, including trees, shrubs, fruits, vegetables, and of course, flowers, and gathered samples from around the world that might have similar conditions, like northern China and Russia.

The Field Station was built by workers in the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was a program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression to put unemployed men to work around the country in a range of areas, including (but definitely not limited to):

And one of their miscellaneous projects was building the new “Central Great Plains Field Station” just outside of Cheyenne.

The CCC was also involved in many other projects across Wyoming: 
- When Jackson Lake grew from a dam, the surrounding trees that became submerged were dangerous, and the CCC took over the job of removing these hazards.
- The CCC started fighting the fires in Campbell County that had been burning for years, caused by random lightning.
- They also built many structures at Guernsey State Park, including the castle, latrine, museum, dock, and drinking fountains, many of which are still used by park visitors today.

The buildings were designed by William Dubois, a successful Wyoming architect who has fourteen buildings on the National Register of Historic Places

Another one of the Civilian Conservation Corps' lasting projec was this Field Station, and one notable project that the Field Station tackled was to find a hardy strawberry plant. After gathering 42,000 plants ranging from New Mexico to Montana, three new varieties were released: the Radiance, Ogallala, and Fort Laramie.

In 1974, the focus of research shifted to focus on grasslands and things like what grazing patterns are best, a very applicable study for the area. And now, the trees and shrubs that managed to survive under minimal care are the strongest of the bunch - they thrived independently in Cheyenne’s harsh climate.
