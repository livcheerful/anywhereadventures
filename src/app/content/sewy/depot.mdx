Union Pacific’s presence in Laramie has always been shifting. In 1868, the Union Pacific built the original depot and hotel to encourage rail travel and provide a place to live for people who worked the depot.

In 1917, a spark from one of the engines on the nearby tracks started a fire that would eventually burn the hotel down. The Laramie Republican, reporting on the fire a day later, said that “It has been afire numerous times, but each time the fire was of little consequence and the repairs were quickly and easily made”.

The decision was made eventually to build on a new location -- the location of the old rolling mill, which had been long retired by 1917.

The new Thornburgh Hotel and Depot were completed in 1924, and operated as a passenger depot for another almost 60 years.

The Laramie Railroad Depot Association now stewards the care of the historic Thornburgh Hotel and railroad depot. 4 pieces of railroad equipment sit in the Railroad Heritage Park now -- a caboose, bunk car, steam engine, and snowplow -- which is a combination of rolling stock that could have operated realistically at some point. The snowplow, as well as the depot itself, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
