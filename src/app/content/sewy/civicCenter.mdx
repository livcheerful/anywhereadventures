When a new town gets started, there are a lot of things to do - figuring out things necessary for survival come first, like food, water, and shelter. However, in Laramie, education was also a high priority.

Only a year after the town started coming together, the first school was built. At Third and Grand, it taught primary school to a student body of 40 people. It was short-lived -- the school relied on donations for operation, and closed soon after it opened.

The Laramie Plains Civic Center (LPCC) is the oldest building still standing in Wyoming that was created for the purpose of being a school. Known as the East Side School, it was built in 1878, and taught students spanning all ages - from elementary school to high school.

The need for a second school building became apparent pretty quickly which resulted in the mirroring West Side School to be built in 1883. It grew to be a community hub, being the only public building in the area, and hosted many public events, such as health screenings, plays, and dances.

Fifty years later, renovations were needed for both schools to expand, and architect Wilbur Hitchcock led the designs for both. He was a prolific architect in the region who built over 300 buildings and houses in Laramie alone despite his early death. Hitchcock studied and later taught at the University of Wyoming, and the library he designed for campus, now the Aven Nelson Building, was named one of the 13 most beautiful libraries in the US.

In 1930, while visiting Los Angeles on his honeymoon, Hitchcock died in a car accident. The renovations of the high schools were still unfinished, and the project was picked up by his partner Walter E Ware.

The murals in the auditorium of the LPCC were painted by Ware’s daughter, Florence Ware, an artist whose work can also be seen in the capitol building in Cheyenne. Her murals for the school still hang in the LPCC auditorium, which is now the Gryphon Theatre.
