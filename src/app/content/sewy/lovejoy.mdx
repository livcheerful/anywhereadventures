He opened Lovejoy Novelty Works, where he would sell things like phonographs out of, do repairs, and ultimately, cars.Enthusiasts, like Lovejoy, made designing and building a motorized car their pastime. When he became the first person in Wyoming to drive a car, he was driving a car he had designed and built.

Even when car manufacturing eventually became a mass-produced industry,  as they are today, Lovejoy was still passionate about them. He worked with the National Highway Association on a road map, adding Laramie and other sights to see in Wyoming to it.

Lovejoy eventually became a dealer of Franklin Motor Cars and sold them out of his shop.  Due to low sale numbers, the motor company thought he was doing a terrible job. When the company sent a Franklin manager to help him improve his marketing techniques, Lovejoy took them around on a tour of the area. Pointing out the ranches where he had sold a car in between the large stretches without a human in sight, and the Franklin manager left impressed that Lovejoy had sold as many vehicles as he did.

In addition to running a car dealership, Lovejoy was still keen on tinkering. Finally in 1912, Lovejoy filed a patent for one of his inventions -- for an automatic garage door opener.

[INCLUDE PICTURE OF PATENT]

His design was clever: it used electricity to open the door, and counterweights to close it, thus saving on electric costs.
