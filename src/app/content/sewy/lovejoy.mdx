Elmer Lovejoy was a relentless tinkerer, inventor, and lover of movement on wheels.

He opened Lovejoy Novelty Works, where he would sell things like phonographs out of, do repairs, and, when cars became popular, sell cars from.

The dream of a motorized car started with people who were passionate about bicycles. At that time, it was people’s hobby to create a car, and Elmer was definitely one of them. Lovejoy was the first person in Wyoming to drive a car, and he drove one of his own invention.

Cars eventually started becoming the mass-produced industry as they are today, and Lovejoy was still passionate about them. He worked with the National Highway Association on a road map, adding Laramie and other sights to see in Wyoming to it.

And he eventually became a dealer of Franklin Motor Cars, who thought he was doing a terrible job. When they sent someone out to help him improve his marketing technique, Lovejoy took them around on a tour of the area. Pointing out the ranches where he had sold a car in between the large stretches without a human in sight, the Franklin manager left impressed that Lovejoy had sold as many vehicles as he did.

But Lovejoy was still keen on tinkering. Finally in 1912, Lovejoy filed a patent for one of his inventions -- for an automatic garage door opener.

[INCLUDE PICTURE OF PATENT]

His design was clever: it only used electricity to open the door, and saved it on the way down by using counterweights intead.
