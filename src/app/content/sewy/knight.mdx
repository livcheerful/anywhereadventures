Dr. Samuel H. Knight was a professor of geology at the University of Wyoming, and his name is attached to so many things -- the geology building itself, the science camp named in his honor in the Medicine Bow Mountains, and even a fossil.

Doc Knight came from a family of geologists - his father was also a professor at the university, and the state fossil of Wyoming was named after him, the Knightia, a freshwater fish that is the most commonly found fish fossil in the world.

Knight was known for both his exciting lectures on geology, and the incredible chalkboard illustrations he would draw to accompany his lessons. He could create detailed diagrams of geologic formations and perfect circles.

He established the Wyoming Science Camp in 1925, a place where students could learn geologic field methods, as well as matters of botany and zoology, amidst the subject matter itself.

Eventually, the camp grew from tents to cabins, which Knight designed and built with the help of five students. To transport things to the camp, they got eleven Franklin cars, which they painted bright yellow with a dinosaur logo. Lecturers and students would come across the country to learn at the camp.

Knight was an ardent educator - thorughout his lifetime, it is estimated that he taught over 13,000 students. While working, he was often disappointed with the number of fossils excavated in Wyoming and sent out of the state -- so he acquired a whole Brontosaurus and assembled it for the museum. After his retirement, he kept working, and taught himself metalwork. He constructed the lifesize T-Rex that sits outside the Geological Museum out of copper plates. The building is also named after him.
