Esther Hobart Morris was a woman built to be a legend and so she became one. She stood at a striking six feet tall and 180 pounds and always wore the latest fashions because she knew people would always be watching her.

She was the first woman to hold public office in the United States as justice of the peace in South Pass City, Wyoming despite not having a law degree or any formal education. In her courtroom, she and her sons said it was “Justice first, then after that the law.”

South Pass City was the largest city along the Oregon Trail. By 1869, the year Morris arrived in South Pass City, over 400,000 people had crossed Wyoming. Mark Twain wrote about his visit to the stage station in his book “Roughing It”:

It wasn’t easy being the first female judge for Morris starting from day one. Her predecessor, J. W. Stillman, refused to turn his court dockets over to a woman.

In his first court appearance, Stillman’s attorney argued that the warrant was improperly issued.

In his second court appearance, Stillman argued that it wouldn’t be a fair trial with her presiding

]}/>


Even though she lost her first court case, she won in the court of public opinion. People thought her decisions were fair, and she prioritized clearly communicating her reasoning over using fancy legal speak.

Less than a year after her initial appointment, Morris’s term came to an end, and she left South Pass City. She followed her son to Laramie, and eventually settled in Cheyenne. Two nine-feet tall statues exist to celebrate her legacy -- one stands in the State Capitol in Cheyenne, and other stands in the US Capitol in Washington DC.
