Esther Hobart Morris was a woman built to be a legend. She stood at a striking six feet tall and 180 pounds and wore the latest fashions because she knew people would always be watching her.

Despite not having a law degree or any formal education, she was the first woman to hold public office in the United States as Justice of the Peace in South Pass City, Wyoming. In her courtroom, she and her sons said it was “Justice first, then after that, the law.”
South Pass City was the largest city along the Oregon Trail and by 1869, the year Morris arrived in the city, over 400,000 people had crossed Wyoming. Mark Twain wrote about his visit to the South Pass City stage station in his book “Roughing It”:

From day one, being the first female judge was not easy. Her predecessor, J. W. Stillman refused to turn his court dockets over to a woman.

In his first court appearance, Stillman’s attorney argued that the warrant was improperly issued.

In his second court appearance, Stillman argued that it wouldn’t be a fair trial since Morris would be the one presiding over the case.

Even though she lost her first court case, she won in the court of public opinion. People thought her decisions were fair, and she prioritized clearly communicating her reasoning over using fancy legal speak.

Less than a year after her initial appointment, Morris’s term came to an end, and she left South Pass City. She followed her son to Laramie, and eventually settled in Cheyenne. Two nine-feet tall statues exist to celebrate her legacy -- one stands in the State Capitol in Cheyenne, and other stands in the US Capitol in Washington DC.
