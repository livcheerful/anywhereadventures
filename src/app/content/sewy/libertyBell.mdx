Here in front of the Wyoming State Museum sits something surprising - the Liberty Bell! It is one of a set of 57 replicas that was created in the 1950s as a part of movement to get people across the United States to invest into savings bonds.

It wasn’t the first time the image of the Liberty Bell was used in a campaign. During the Great War, the country needed to raise money to support the Allied cause. The government employed celebrities at the time, such as Charlie Chaplin, to encourage people to support the cause, but it was completely ineffective. So they turned to the Liberty Bell, and created a campaign around it: ringing the bell thirteen times for each of the original thirteen colonies, and having every other bell in the nation ringing at the same time.

With such a successful strategy, the United States invoked the bell's image again when they wanted to raise awareness for the Independence Bond Drive in May of 1950. This time, 57 full-sized replicas of the bell was forged in France. One was sent to each state, to be toured around in custom trucks, and finally arriving in each state’s respective capitol.

Cheyenne’s Liberty Bell, however, is special from the rest: it has serial number 0, which can be seen as a tiny number above the word “unto”.

However, the Liberty Bell’s story in Wyoming doesn’t end there: the real life, original bell has actually visited Cheyenne in the past! In 1915, when San Francisco held its world’s fair, it requested from the state of Pennsylvania the nation’s icon.

After debating the logistics of how best to transport a treasure across the country, it was finally decided that the bell would ride on a special train, with “a baggage car, diner, three sleepers,  a special car for the reception of guests en route, and a car for the bell’. The bell’s train car was specially created to carry it, and the whole train made stops along the railway, including Cheyenne.
