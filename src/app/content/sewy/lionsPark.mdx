James Jenkins arrive in Baraboo, Wisconsin against his will -- his parents both immigrated there from Liverpool, England in early 1852, along with his grandparents and four other siblings. He was born in October that year, and was the youngest of the family.

His eldest brother, John Jenkins, was a lawyer who later served as the state representative. In 1876, he was appointted to be a US States Attorney for the territory of Wyoming. He convinced his brother, James, to move to Wyoming with him, and that is how they ended up in Cheyenne.

On his first day in Cheyenne, the brothers had dinner at Fort David Russell, as the elder John had to defend two of the officers in court. John eventually moved back to Wisconsin after his appointed ended, but James enjoyed Wyoming, and sent for his wife to move to the new state with him.

James settled in Cheyenne. In 1878, when Jenkins planted his first tree in Cheyenne, it was a treeless prairie town. He took it upon himself to make Cheyenne a City of Trees.

Arbor Day was a new holiday established in Nebraska in 1874, aiming to get a growth of new trees planted to help beautify and conserve the area. The movement caught on in Wyoming, where the reasons to plant trees were compelling:

The first Arbor Day started off with a grand parade as a tree, loaded onto a wagon with a flag tied to its top, was planted in the first park in the city at 22nd St and Central Avenue. This first park, at the time fresh and new, is now known as the Old City Park, whose site now hosts the Wyoming State Supreme Court and the Wyoming State Museum.

Arbor Day was nearly repealed in 1920, and Jenkins was upset at the thought that the beautiful land around Sloan's Lake wouldn't reach its full potential. He wrote a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, who found his vision compelling and appointed him a "committee of one" to plant trees around the city.

Sloan’s Lake grove was overgrown, with clover over 5 feet tall. But Jenkins painted a picture for the Lion’s Club, who was tasked with beautifying the area. He said “Gentlemen, if these grounds were cleaned up, this is the ideal spot for picnics and pleasure.” This motivated one of the members so much he shouted out with pride, “LIONS PARK!”, and that’s how it got its name.
