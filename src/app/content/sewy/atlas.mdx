Since its early days, Cheyenne has been a city that’s had an appetite for arts and entertainment. In the 1880s, when it was clear that the town would be around for the long haul, permanent buildings were constructed, including houses, the train depot, and the Atlas Building.
Before it was the Atlas Theatre, the location was known as the Atlas Block. Built in 1887, the building was remodeled twenty years later in 1907 by William Dubois, who turned it into a venue that could hold an audience of 550 people.

When people from the entertainment industry came to see the new theatre, they said it was the “prettiest showhouse west of the Missouri”.

The Atlas Theatre boasted of a huge variety of shows, including a play featuring "President Roosvelt with his stick riding a horse that breathed fire from its eyes and mouth.", movies such as *The Four Horsemen*, and a production of "Civilization -- the Million Dollar Spectacle", which was advertised as "Far Greater than the 'Birth of a Nation'".

One of the most impressive things about the theatre is something that hangs inside it - the hand-painted asbestos grand drape that hangs at the front of the stage.

<LOCItem image="/loc/sewy/atlas/curtain.jpg" caption="An illustration of the curtain at the front of the stage" linkOut="https://www.loc.gov/item/wy0017/" alt="A color print of the asbestos fire curtain at the front of the Atlas Theater stage. The curtain features multiple business advertisements around the border, and 20th century Venice in the center. 
"/>

In the early 1900s, these painted curtains had many uses. First, the detailed scenery brought theatre-goers to a magical place. In the case of the Atlas, the scene depicted is Venice, Italy.

Second, the curtain operates as a fire safety measure -- the curtain is triple layered, with fabric sandwiching the asbestos inside. In the event of a fire backstage, it would slow the advancing flames and give audience members time to evacuate.

And perhaps one of its most interesting uses -- the Atlas’s curtains feature a border of advertisements for the businesses of the day
