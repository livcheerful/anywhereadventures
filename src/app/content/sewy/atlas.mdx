Since its early days, Cheyenne has been a city that’s had appetite for arts and entertainment. When it was clear that the town was around for the long haul in the 1880’s, buildings started to be constructed to be more permanent, including houses, the train depot, and Atlas Building.

Before it was the Atlas Theatre, the location was know as the Atlas Block. The Atlas Building was developed in 1887, and though it was not a theatre at the time, William Dubois remodeled it in 1907 to become a venue that could hold an audience of 550.

When people from the entertainment industry came to see the new theatre, they said it was the “prettiest showhouse west of the Missouri”.

The Atlas Theatre boast of a huge variety of shows, including a play featuring "President Roosvelt with his stick riding a horse that breathed fire from its eyes and mouth.", movies such as The Four Horsemen, and a production of "Civilization -- the Million Dollar Spectacle", which was advertised as "Far Greater than the 'Birth of a Nation'".

One of the most impressive things about the theatre is something that resides within it - the hand painted asbestos grand drape that hangs at the front of the stage.

In the early 1900s, these painted curtains provided many functions: first, the detailed scenery brought theatre-goers to a magical place. In the case of the Atlas, the scene depicted is of Venice, Italy.

Second, the curtain operates as a fire safety measure -- the curtain is triple layered, with fabric sandwiching the asbestos inside. It slows the fire down between stage and auditorium, so that audience members can evacuate.

And perhaps one of its most interesting uses -- the Atlas’s curtains feature a border of advertisements for the businesses of the day
