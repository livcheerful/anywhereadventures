Water can make or break a city -- not only is it necessary to find a clean source to drink, but being near water can often accelerate a city’s growth as a center of commerce and transportation.


Chicago is no different - in the 1830s, a huge project began to build the Illinois & Michigan Canal. This canal would be the first to connect Lake Michigan (and consequentially, all the Great Lakes) to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois River and then the Mississippi.

However, the water that you see here today isn’t the I&M Canal. In the late 1800s, Chicago was facing a crisis - its water supply was unreliable. Sewage and pollution from rebuilding the city after the Great Fire were finding their way into the Chicago River which fed into Lake Michigan, causing concern that the water was no longer suitable for drinking.

Thus began one of the wildest engineering projects in the history of the country. The state of Illinois decided to construct the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to replace parts of the I&M, which, in addition to widening and deepening the previous canal, reversed the flow of the Chicago River.

The decision to reverse the river was controversial, even back then. Because the main point was to dilute the sewage by having it flow through a larger volume of water, people downstream suffered the consequences, including the city of St. Louis, who sued Chicago to reverse the flow.

The canal is still used for barge traffic. To the north, you can see the wide turning basin where ships used to turn around, and just above that, is where the Chicago River meets the mouth of the canal.

And the plan for clean water worked -- now, the city boasts that the fish habitat here is one of the best in Chicago.
