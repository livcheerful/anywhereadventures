The Chicago Public Library was born out of the ruins of the Great Fire. Before the fire, there had only been private libraries, and it was through the inspiration of two Englishmen who had the idea and drive to collect over 8,000 books to send to the city as an act of “brotherly kindness”.

Having received such a large donation, the next task was to find a physical location for the library. Over the next two decades, the library roamed across temporary locations, including a water tank and the fourth floor of city hall.

The call for building proposals came out with very specific requirements. It was planned to be built on the site of Dearborn Park, outlined by Michigan Ave, Randolph St, Washington St, and North Garland Court.

Some of the other building requirements included:
- It should be built of stone -- either granite or Bedford bluestone -- and not of steel and brick
- The exterior should make it clear that it is a library
- The rooms should be built with independent fireproof sections.

- And all of this should cost no more than $1,200,000

The contract was awarded to the Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge firm, who also designed the nearby Art Institute.


Every detail that could be thought out was -- including the mural that appears above the southern stairs. This mural is a mosaic made of pieces of glass, mother of pearl and shells, and stones are laid into marble. The choice of mosaic over a painted mural was because of the nearby railyards, whose smoke would have damaged paint.

However, this building is no longer the home to the Chicago Public Library -- in the 60s, library technologies had evolved librarians found that the building wasn't convinient anymore. It was clear that a new building was needed. In 1981, Mayor Harold Washington approved the budget to build the new central library on a one-and-a-half block lot.

Today, the Chicago Public Library has over 5 million books, 81 locations, and in the last year issued over 160,000 new library cards. Its seal incorporates the city of Chicago “municipal device” which represents the north, south, and main branch of the Chicago River.
