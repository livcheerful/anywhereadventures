The Chicago Public Library was born out of the ruins of the Great Fire. In the fire’s aftermath, two Englishmen collected and gifted 8,000 books to the city as an act of “brotherly kindness.”

Prior to the fire, there were no public libraries, so the next task was to find a physical location for  such a large donation. Over the next two decades, the library moved from one temporary location to the next, including a water tank and the fourth floor of City Hall.

The plan was for the library to be built on the site of Dearborn Park, outlined by Michigan Ave, Randolph St, Washington St, and North Garland Court.

Some of the other building requirements included:
- It should be built of stone -- either granite or Bedford bluestone -- and not of steel and brick.
- The exterior should make it clear that the building is a library.
- The rooms should be built with independent fireproof sections.

- And all of this should cost no more than $1,200,000

The contract was awarded to the Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge firm, who also designed the nearby Art Institute.


Every detail was perfectly planned -- including the mural that appears above the southern stairs. The mural is a mosaic made of pieces of glass, mother of pearl, shells, and stones  laid into marble. A mosaic mural was chosen over a painted mural because of the library’s proximity to nearby rail yards, whose smoke would have damaged the paint.

However, this building is no longer the home to the Chicago Public Library -- in the 1960s, library technologies had evolved and librarians found that the building was ill-suited for the library’s growing needs. It was clear that a new building was needed and in 1981, Mayor Harold Washington approved a budget to build the new central library on a one-and-a-half block lot.

Today, the Chicago Public Library has over 5 million books, 81 locations, and in the last year issued over 160,000 new library cards. Its seal incorporates the city of Chicago's “municipal device” which represents the north, south, and main branch of the Chicago River.
