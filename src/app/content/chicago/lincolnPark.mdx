All the way over in Washington DC is the National Statuary Hall - with two statues for each state, over 100 statues stand representing some of the most notable people in American history. But much closer to home, Lincoln Park is known as Chicago’s outdoor Statuary Hall. With so many other fun things to do, it’s easier to overlook these stationary figures. However, learning some of the stories behind them make it more fun to stop and look around!

# Statue 1: Chess Pavilion

The Chess Pavilion might not look like a typical sculpture -- with three tiers and 20 embedded chess boards, it is useful as a space where people can gather. Throughout the pavilion, however, are sculptural elements -- the detailed bas-relief carvings of chess pieces, incised carvings, and two five-foot tall sculptures created by sculptor Boris Gilbertson.

# Statue 2: Dream Lady - Eugene Field Memorial

Eugene Field, born in St. Louis and later a Chicago resident, was a writer. He contributed to newspapers like the Chicago Daily with light-hearted articles about things happening around town. He eventually became known for his children's poems. When he died in 1895, he was considered the United State’s children’s poet laureate.

To raise funds for the memorial, schoolchildren donated their pocket money. The memorial has a lot of imagery referring to Field’s work, and excerpts from his poems are featured on both sides of the base. Designed by architects Delano & Aldrich and sculptor Edward Francis McCarten, the Dream Lady floats about the sleeping children with a fistful of poppies.

# Statue 3: Emanuel Swedenborg Monument

A bust of the Swedish scientist happened to find itself in this city, though he had nothing to do with Chicago. Created by Swedish sculptor Adolf Johnson, it was originally owned by  Dr. Minnie Ridgeway Bishop and Louis Bracket Bishop who offered to donate it to the park. A granite base was created to hold the new addition, and it stood there from 1924 until 1976, when it was stolen.

]}/>

The pyramid was left until 2009 when a car accident destroyed the granite base. It was at this time that Chicago Park District discovered that the model for the original bust still existed, and commissioned sculptor Magnus Persson to replace the whole monument.
