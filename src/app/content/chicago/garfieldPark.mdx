When it first opened in 1874, Garfield Park was originally known as Chicago’s Central Park. Planned as the crown jewel of Chicago’s West Side parks system, it was inspired by the gardens in French parks. However, over the remainder of the century, it deteriorated due to neglect, and by the turn of the century, much of its lawns had become overgrown and unusable.

In 1905, the new West Park System superintendent, Jens Jensen, started to redesign and reenvision the park. At this point, the park had quadrupled in size -- from 40 acres to over 180. A part of this overhaul was to rethink the conservatories in the various parks in his jurisdiction -- in an effort to consolidate three typical plant conservatories into a monumental one, he demolished the existing buildings in Garfield,  Humboldt, and Douglass Park and built a new one in Garfield.

Known as one of the largest conservatories in the entire country, Garfield’s new conservatory had many plants from the three smaller conservatories it had absorbed. The building itself was magnificent -- the large silhouette cast by the Palm Room was designed to evoke a haystack. Each room of the conservatory is capped by a different type of roof -- the Fern Room sitting behind the Palm has a gable roof.

Most importantly in the conservatory are the plants. Jensen’s plan for the landscape design diverged from typical conservatories at the time -- instead of plants sitting in individual pots, he wanted each room to feel like a natural, beautiful scene.

Throughout its life, the Garfield Park Conservatory has adapted to serve the surrounding community's interests and into a busy city green space. In addition to being a space for plants and plant lovers, the Conservatory hosts plant shows and art exhibitions and offers many community events.
