Chicago’s transit system is very notable - it is one of only 3 cities in the world to offer 24-hour service on parts of its lines, it is the second oldest system in the United States, and has the longest subway platform in the world. This network of rails took a long time to come together, and started in 1888.

With the city rapidly growing in population and size, the need for convenient transportation also grew. Up until the 1880s, Chicago’s street railways were “nearly all animal power”, and it was clear that more permanent infrastructure would be necessary.

However, the logistics for obtaining permission to build the tracks were extremely difficult. The “L” started off as many smaller companies creating lines for a section of town outside of the central business district. The first to open in 1892 was the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad Company who avoided the complicated permit issue by building along the alleys instead of the street, making the process much cheaper.

The following year, the Lake Street “L”, which ran from 52nd Avenue to Market & Madison, became a part of the Green Line.

The Northwestern Elevated Railroad Company was also built under Yerkes, and the Union Loop, which finally connected the lines into the heart of the city, was Yerkes’ as well.

Having so many individual companies was not sustainable, so in 1924, they were all consolidated into the Chicago Rapid Transit Company (another private company). It wasn’t until the 1940s that the municipally-owned Chicago Transit Authority took over all the lines.

Today, Ashland Station is one of the oldest stations still in use. It was built in 1893 as part of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad. Its exterior, restored to a bright green, pink, and cream, highlights its Victorian finishes, and, happily, also matches the color lines it serves.
