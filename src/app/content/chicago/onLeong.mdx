There have been many Chinatowns in Chicago -- since the 1870s, the Chinese community has convened and grown. The first Chinatown was in the Loop, on Clark Street between Adams and Van Buren. With rising tensions and racial discrimination in the late 1800s, especially in the West Coast, Chicago saw its Chinese population increase dramatically.

However, the anti-Chinese sentiment was also felt in Chicago -- with increased incidents of harassment and unsustainable raised rents, people started wondering if the first Chinatown was unsustainable. In February 1912, a coordinated move to Cermak and Wentworth started the “New Chinatown”.  Driving this move was the On Leong Merchants Association, and their members secured around 50 10-year leases, signifying that this New Chinatown was here to stay.

In 1926, the On Leong Association wanted a more permanent space. As a community organizer, they needed a building that could house all the events and gatherings they held. They hired the Michaelsen and Rognstad firm to design the new building, as there were no Chinese architects working in this time.

Michaelsen and Rognstad did their research on Chinese architecture and design through books such as the German book *Chinesische Architekture*. What resulted was in an amalgamation of Chinese-inspired design elements onv a very Chicago building.

The On Leong Building was a huge success -- in its heyday, it served as a major community space, with after-school programs for students, new immigrant support, and lots of activities and celebrations. The idea was to be like a “gas station” -- one stop shop for everything people need on their trip to living in Chicago.
