Sitting along side the northern branch of the Red Line is the Graceland Cemetery -- covering 119 acres, you’ll find the final resting places of many old Chicago names like Kate Warne, the first female detective, and William Wallace Kimball, the founder of Kimball Pianos.
Graceland is also a center for architecture -- both in the people buried there, but also in the structures that were built there. Some of the United States’ most architecturally significant monuments lay in Graceland. Walk around to see them, and read about three of them here:

# 1. The Ryerson Tomb
The first stop houses Martin L. Ryerson, a lumber businessman. When he died, his son, Martin A. Ryerson, hired Louis Sullivan to design his father’s tomb.

Louis Sullivan, known as the “father of skyscrapers” and part of the “trinity of American architecture”, was inspired by Egyptian burial traditions when designing this tomb. He combined two concepts: the mastaba, which predated pyramids and featured a flat roof with sloping sides, and the iconic pyramid.

This tomb is one of few examples of Egyptian Revival style still in the US, and is notable in its lack of Egyptian motifs on its exterior -- with a floral design attached to its gate.

# 2. The Honore Tomb
This second tomb, just north of the Ryerson Tomb, holds Henry Hamilton Honore, known for founding the Chicago Park District.

It was designed by one of the largest architecture firms in the United States at the time, McKim, Mead & White, who also designed the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Boston Public Library building, and the English Building at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus.

This tomb is styled in the French High Gothic Revival tradition, similar to the ornate churches that can be found in France, with extremely detailed stonework. The Smithsonian recognizes it as one of America’s most “significant sculptural works”.

Five sarcophagi sit on the pedestal, and both Henry and his wife Eliza rest there. Of their six children, three were entombed with them: Lockwood, Nathaniel, and Adrian.

# 3. The Getty Tomb
This tomb is the second of three mausoleums that Louis Sullivan designed in his career: the last is in St. Louis. It was commissioned by Henry Getty for his wife, Eliza. Getty and Ryerson were business partners and Getty admired the work Sullivan did for Ryerson’s tomb.

There are Art Nouveau elements on the pair of gates guarding the tomb. On the exterior, you’ll find the letter G weaved into the metal medallion among the florals, and on the interior, you’ll find the date “1890”. These elements define Sullivan’s style.

Louis Sullivan himself is also buried here in Graceland, though his marker isn’t nearly as ornate as the ones he built for others. See if you can spot it near the Ryerson Tomb.
