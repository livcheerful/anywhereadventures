Muddy Waters was a Chicago blues musician in the mid-1900s whose guitar and musical stylings influenced the development of the music we hear today.

Muddy Waters grew up in the Mississippi Delta and started playing the guitar at 17. He toured with local bands, and played at various dances, parties, picnics, and events. Alan Lomax, a folklorist and archivist working with the Library of Congress, went to Mississippi to record Muddy Waters and capture the sounds of rural blues music.

When the record was pressed, Muddy Waters received a couple of copies and $20 in the mail. He immediately played the record on his machine, and soon after, in 1943, he left for Memphis and then Chicago to pursue a full-time music career.

The first few years in Chicago were difficult -- life as a Black musician in the city posed extra challenges, but he and other migrant musicians were persistent. Banned from certain venues who would only hire white musicians, they would create their own opportunities by playing on popular market streets such as the Maxwell Street Market District.

After a couple of years and many setbacks, Muddy Waters recorded several hit songs, which catapulted him to commercial success. He would eventually be known as the "father of Chicago blues." 

This is the location of Muddy's former home -- the first he ever purchased in Chicago. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a Chicago Landmark. 43rd Ave, the street leading up to his neighborhood, was dedicated "Muddy Waters Drive" in his honor.
