Muddy Waters was a Chicago blues musician in the mid-1900s whose guitar and musical stylings influenced the development of music we hear today.

Muddy Waters grew up in the Mississippi Delta and started playing the guitar at 17. He toured with local bands, and played at various dances, parties, picnics, and events. Alan Lomax, a folklorist and archivist working with the Library of Congress, came to record Muddy Waters to capture the rural blues music.

When the record was pressed, Muddy Waters received a couple of copies and $20 in the mail. He immediately played the record on his machine, and soon after, in 1943, he left for Memphis and then Chicago to pursue a full time music career.

The first few years in Chicago were difficult -- life as a Black musician in the city posed extra challenges, but he and other migrant musicians were persistent. Banned from certain venues who would only hire white musicians, they would create their own opportunities by playing on popular market streets such as the Maxwell Street Market District.

After a couple of years and many setbacks, Muddy Waters recorded several hit songs, which cascaded his career into commercial success and eventually his influence into infamy.

This is the location of Muddy's former home -- the first he ever purchased in Chicago. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a Chicago Landmark. 43rd Ave, the street leading up to his neighborhood, was dedicated "Muddy Waters Drive" in his honor.
