A majority of Seattle’s parks were designed by the Olmsted Brothers firm in 1903, which envisioned a large system of greenery across the city that highlighted the natural beauty and shape of the land. The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.

When the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.

Ravenna Park was notable for two things:

- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.
- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.

John Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city for these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city.

Louise Beck had many naming ceremonies for the trees she named and even invited John Olmsted to attend the christening of Roosevelt while he was in town in 1908.

  caption="Dear Madam:
Your letter of Dec. 27th has only just reached me having been taken to Boston by Mr. Dawson. 

I thank you for your kind offer of hospitality.

As the matter to which you refer -might possibly be referred to me by the Park Board for report. It would be premature for me to examine into it at this time.
I may say, however, that I am in hearty sympathy with the idea of preserving Ravenna Park as a public Park.
Yours very truly, 
John C. Olmsted."

In 1909, the city acquired the park from the Becks. Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.

William Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.

The trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. 

Most future trees are now protected by <a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.
