In 1968, Seattle voters passed 7 of 12 propositions as a part of Forward Thrust, which aimed to improve Seattle to support the growth of population it expected. These initiatives helped create lots of things that are Seattle staples nowadays, including the Seattle Aquarium and the Kingdome, whose site now hosts the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Sounders.

Each pool had a different architectural style, and the Queen Anne Pool project was granted to Benjamin F. McAdoo Jr, a prolific Washington architect who was also the first licensed Black architect in the state.

He was well known for his Northwest modern style, which uses floor to ceiling glass, flat roofs, and asymmetrical layouts.

The Queen Anne Pool was not an easy project. It was the last to be built of the seven Forward Thrust pools, and its first challenge was finding a location. The Forward Thrust pools were supposed to be built adjacent to local high schools so that they could be used for practice, but property values in Queen Anne were very high. A compromise was made, and it was decided that the pool should be built next to McClure Middle School instead.

Even after it was built, incidents delayed the pool - the humidity turned the exposed bricks white, and the thermometer controlling the pool’s temperature broke, which raised the water to a balmy 100 degrees.

The exterior of the pool was design to match the neighboring middle school, but McAdoo’s modernist touch can be best seen from the interior with its exposed brick, concrete, and wood.

McAdoo believed that as an architect, he could have an impact on creating fair housing. So while he worked on grand structures, including even the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, he also designed low-cost houses like he “House of Merit” plan, which was a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom house. This design was adopted for many houses in the Central District.
