Ballard wasn’t always part of Seattle - in its early days, it was an independent town.

Incorporated in 1889, they had all the things that a town would need, including a post office, a city hall, a Carnegie Library, and a *wooden* fire station.

But the new town was missing one critical piece -- access to fresh water. Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water. And although it was the second-largest town in King County, in 1907, Ballard became a part of the larger town.

In 1910, Seattle replaced the wooden fire station with the red brick building that still stands today. The architects for the new structure were Bebb & Mendel, who also designed the University Heights Elementary School and the Oriental Building in Downtown Seattle. Bebb later went on to design the Seattle Asian Art Museum (known at the time as the Art Institute of Seattle).

At the time, fire engines were powered by horses, so the area at the back of the station contained horse stalls.

At times, extra support was needed to handle some fires. In 1958, the Seattle Cedar Mill had a catastrophic fire. Located right next to the Ballard Bridge on the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the mill would process logs into boards, and then store them to have them dry for months before being sold.

The fire was so large that it burned for three days straight. The city had engines reporting from seven different stations around the city to come and help, and because the mill was so close to the canal, the city's fireboat was also engaged.

The Fireboat Duwamish is part of Seattle's firefighting fleet, and arrives when fires pop up near or on the water. For the Ballard lumber mill fire, it arrived on site from its home at Fire Station 5, located north of Colman Dock in downtown, and fought the fire from the canal.

The Ballard Firehouse still stands today, even though it’s no longer used as a fire station. It’s one of the few structures remaining from historic Ballard - others are the Ballard Bridge, the Ballard Locks, and the Carnegie Library.
