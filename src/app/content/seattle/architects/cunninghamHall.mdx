Creating a building is a lot of work**! **Some projects get delayed years at the beginning, just choosing the perfect spot for the structure.

HOWEVER this is, surprisingly, Not True, as demonstrated by Cunningham Hall. 

Cunningham Hall was built for the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle. The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.

To create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.

Cunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.

<LOCItem caption="The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business. With its wooden architecture, it stood out like a sore thumb compared to the other stucco-clad buildings of the A-Y-P." alt="photograph of building with exposed wood on outside." image="/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/hoo.png" linkOut="https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0056.photos/?sp=3"/>

In 2008, the university wanted to build its new molecular engineering building on the site of Cunningham Hall. However, aware of its history, the decision was made to preserve the building by moving it to a new location.

    {type:"text", src:"I didn't know I could move... seems hard.", position:{col:2, row:7}, size:{width:3, height:2}, style:{outline: "box"}},
]}/> 

It was, in fact, difficult to move. The first reason being that it was not heavy enough. The building was estimated to be over 400,000 pounds, and so it was placed on 28 dollies to spread the work around.

The other problem was the path the building planned to take across campus, which involved crossing the Central Plaza Garage -- the underground parking garage below the Red Square.

]}/>  

Somehow, Cunningham Hall was both too heavy and too light. Despite all the (metaphorical) roadblocks, the 100 year old two-story building was moved .3 to its new home!
