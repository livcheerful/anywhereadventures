Historic buildings can be seen all around the world, but Seattle is special because it also has a fleet of treasured historic boats. These boats, floating at Lake Union Park’s Historic Ship Wharf, are the collection of some of Seattle’s most impressive “-est”-es:


The oldest lightship:

The *Arthur Foss* held many jobs. It started off in Astoria, Oregon, navigating the dangerous mouth of the Columbia River where it dumps into the Pacific Ocean. In the waters dubbed the “graveyard of the Pacific”, the *Arthur Foss*, then known as the *Wallowa*, would act as an experienced guide and tow boats through the crossing.

In 1929, the Foss Launch & Tug Company bought the *Wallowa* and renamed it the *Arthur Foss*. To help the company pay for the cost of the vessel, they leased it out to feature as the titular boat in Tugboat Annie, the first major movie filmed in Washington State.

Despite becoming an A-list celebrity, the Arthur Foss continued to work as a tugboat, and found itself it many dangerous situations.

    {type:"text", src:"In 1937, it caught fire, and was forcefully sunk to avoid burning down completely.",position:{col: 1, row: 1}, size: {width:4, height: 2}, style:{outline: "none", fontSize: "1rem"}},

    {type:"text",src:"I guess this is better than being on fire...", position:{ col: 2, row:10}, size:{width: 2, height: 2}, style:{outline: "bubble", fontSize: "1rem"}},
    {type: "image", alt:"A brightly colored comic showing the Arthur Foss tugboat frowning at the bottom of the ocean with a couple of fish swimming around it.", src:"/loc/seattle/tugboatFoss/fire3.png", position:{ col: 1, row:11}, size:{width: 4, height: 7}, alt:""},
]}/>

In 1941, it found itself caught in Hawaii during the war. Afraid that its bright white and green paint would attract torpedoes, the crew mixed white paint with engine grease to paint the boat a dark gray to blend in with the ocean.


<ComicSection cols={4} elements={[
    {type:"text", src:"Better this than sinking again.", position:{col: 3, row: 1}, size: {width:2, height: 1}, style:{outline: "bubble",}, },
    {type:"image", alt:"A brightly colored comic of the Arthur Foss tugboat covered in gray smudges, and its eyes narrowed in annoyance.", src:"/loc/seattle/tugboatFoss/paint.png",position:{col: 1, row: 1}, size: {width:3, height: 3},},
]}/>

And in 1947, while being transported back from Hawaii, it fell off its keel blocks and damaged its hull.

Finally, it was retired in 1968. The Foss Launch and Tug Company, however, is still in operation as the largest tug company on the west coast, and you can see other tug boats still bearing the “Foss” name navigating the ship canal.
