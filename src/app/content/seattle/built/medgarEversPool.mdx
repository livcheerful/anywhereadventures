The Medgar Evers pool was funded in part by the federal Model Cities program, which aimed to provide more equitable recreation and athletic activities in cities across the United States. Seattle applied for the federal grant to create better infrastructure for its International District, Pioneer Square, and Central Area neighborhoods.

Built in the historically Black neighborhood of the Central Area, it was through a community petition that the pool be named in memory of Evers, who had been assassinated only a few years earlier in Mississippi.

At the time, Seattle was also examining its own discriminatory practices. In the wake of MLK’s assassination, Seattle passed Ordinance 96619 to prohibit covenants and sundown zones in the city. 

Seattle has a large Black community, with three large migrations of folks coming to the city in hopes of a good life. This dream was heavily championed by Horace R. Cayton Sr., a journalist and eventual creator of the Seattle Republican, which, of Seattle’s seven African American newspapers, was the most successful and was published from 1894 until 1915.

The Seattle Republican had national spread, having Pullman Porters distribute papers on their train runs from the west coast to the east.

Note: this is not to say that there was no discrimination against African American people in Seattle. The Seattle Republican eventually shut down when Cayton lost a lawsuit he against a restaurant that refused future service to him.

But as time went on, and as many of the Chinese and Indigenous people were driven out of Seattle, more hatred was directed towards Seattle’s Black community. For example, though not written in law, some practices systematically blocked people of color from purchasing homes in specific neighborhoods.

With the new pool being built in Seattle’s Central District, the community petitioned to name it after Medgar Evers. In a document, they wrote of him:

“He became a hero, not because he died, but because he learned to live with the mounting probability of violent death and refused to turn aside. Because his life so symbolized the struggle of a whole people to be free, he was shot in the back.”
