Built in 1940, it had been a dream of Seattle engineer Homer Hadley since the 1920s to connect the city to the eastside. Without the bridge, the only way to access Seattle was approaching from the north or south, or via ferry.

The solution he came up with was not far off from his original idea. A bridge suspended over the water would have been difficult because of the size of the lake. At its widest, Lake Washington can span 4 miles and some parts reach 220 feet deep. Homer Hadley proposed that, instead, the lake should be crossed with a pontoon bridge.

However, with the bridge approaching the land at water level, a tunnel would have to be carved through the tall Mount Baker Ridge that guards Seattle on the east. Thus, two feats of engineering were created:

*Footnote:*
There are two bridges supporting I-90. The one that moves traffic eastward is named after Lacey V. Murrow, the director whose support of the floating bridge actually got it built. The one that moves traffic westward is the Third Lake Washington Bridge, and was dedicated in 1993 to the first person to dream of crossing Lake Washington with concrete and chose its site, Homer Hadley.
