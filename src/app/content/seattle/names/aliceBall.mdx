Leprosy is a bacterial disease that has been devastating humans for thousands of years. In the past, there was nothing you could do if you got it. You would just be shipped off to live with other people with the disease and be legally considered dead.

That was, until this photo... kinda.

This photo was taken by John Presley Bell, and was produced via daguerreotype, which was the first popular process to capture photographs in the mid-1800s. It uses a chemical process that exposes light on a plate coated in silver. Bell was an accomplished daguerreotypist, opening studios across the country, and eventually settling in Seattle.

Alice Ball was born in 1892 in Seattle, WA into a family of photographers - John Presley Ball was her grandfather - and, perhaps inspired by the photography process, she studied chemistry at the University of Washington.

She then got her master’s in chemistry at the University of Hawai’i, where her thesis explored the chemical makeup of a plant that could be used to treat many illnesses, from anxiety to kidney disorders. She was both the first woman and the first African American to get a master’s from UH.

So even though there had a medicine to treat leprosy for centuries, there was no way to give it to patients. But Alice Ball, at age 23, developed a chemical method so that the water insoluble acid could be suspended in water and injected comfortably.

When she died less than a year later at the age of 24, the dean of medicine (coincidentally named Arthur Dean) at the university took over her research and eventually published it as the “Dean method”.

Despite Hollmann’s best efforts, it was still considered the “Dean method” until the 1970s, when two professors at the University of Hawai’i rediscovered the story of Ball’s work.

The Ball Method was the only way to treat leprosy until antibiotics were popularized in the 1940s, and Alice Ball Park celebrates her nearly forgotten legacy as a professor and pioneering scientist.
