The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\r\n\r\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair.

Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water.

Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"map\"\r\n    caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\"\r\n    alt=\"A colorized drawing depicting a bird’s eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Expostion fair grounds in 1909.\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\r\n\r\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square.

Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water.

At that time, it was common to have closed stacks -- if a patron wanted to see a book, they would have to ask the librarian to fetch it for them. \r\n\r\n<ComicSection cols={5} rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/line.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:5, height:4}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"As you can imagine, this doesn't scale very well.\",position:{col:1, row:6}, size:{width:3, height:3}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 50}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/talking.png\", position:{col:1, row:9}, size:{width:5, height:6}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"So we were the first library on the West Coast to open up our book stacks for people to just browse!\",position:{col:3, row:13}, size:{width:3, height:3}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 250}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/alarm.png\", position:{col:4, row:16}, size:{width:3, height:5}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"Excuse me, Mr. Smith!

The equivalent of $7.5 million dollars today, the city used this funding to purchase the whole city block between 4th and 5th avenue on Madison and Spring, which is the same location where the Central Library sits today.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"map\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/seattleMap.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.pm009770/?r=0.409,0.25,0.286,0.196,0\"\r\n    caption=\"\"\r\n    alt=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ComicSection cols={7} overlap={100} rowHeight=\"2rem\" elements={[\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"But this doesn't look anything like the current Seattle Public Library.\",position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:3}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 10}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/smith1.png\", position:{col:4, row:1}, size:{width:2, height:2}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"Ours is more..\",position:{col:6, row:2}, size:{width:2, height:2}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 180}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/somervellAndThomas/smithTwo.png\", position:{col:1, row:5}, size:{width:7, height:8}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\", fontSize: \"1.3rem\"}, src:\"Geometric\",position:{col:4, row:7}, size:{width:2, height:3}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\" , backgroundColor: \"white\", fontSize:\"1rem\"}, src:\"Yeah, in 1998, Seattle voters voted in favor of the largest library bond initiative at the time, and funded almost $200 million in renovations for Seattle’s libraries.

Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\r\n\r\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"map\"\r\n    caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\"\r\n    alt=\"A colorized drawing depicting a bird’s eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Expostion fair grounds in 1909.\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\r\n\r\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water. And although it was the second-largest town in King County, in 1907, it was decided that Ballard would become a part of the largest town in King County, Seattle.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"newspaper\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/ballard.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn87093407/1907-02-06/ed-1/?sp=1&q=ballard+annexation&r=0.604,0.48,0.518,0.358,0\"\r\n    alt=\"1)\tZoomed-in view of newspaper article with the title, “Ballard Annexation is Being Discussed.”  Article discusses the annexation of the town of Ballard to Seattle.\"\r\n    caption=\"Citizens of Ballard were not happy with the decision.

The architects for the new structure were Bebb & Mendel, who also designed the University Heights Elementary School and the Oriental Building in Downtown Seattle. Bebb later went on to design the Seattle Asian Art Museum (known at the time as the Art Institute of Seattle).\r\n\r\nAt the time, fire engines were powered by horses, so the back area of the station was a stable.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/firehorse.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a27542/\"\r\n    caption=\"Horse-drawn fire engine rushing to a fire.\"\r\n    alt=\"Photograph shows three white horses rushing down city street pulling a steam fire engine carrying three fire fighters\"/>\r\n<ComicSection elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", alt:\"Brightly colored comic panel showing the front of the Ballard fire station with four large bay doors, against a blue sky with white clouds and birds flying in the distance.\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/station.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:3}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"1rem\"}, src:\"The front the station has four bay doors.\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"2rem\"}, src:\"Perfect for a team of horses on their way to work!\", position:{col:1, row:5}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", alt:\"Brightly colored comic panel showing three determined horses bursting out of one of the fire station’s bay doors, pulling a fire engine with a serious fire fighter sitting atop the engine.\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/horses.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:3, height:7}},\r\n    ]}/>\r\n\r\nAt times, extra support was needed to handle some fires. In 1958, the Seattle Cedar Mill had a catastrophic fire. Located right next to the Ballard Bridge on the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the mill would process logs into boards, and then store them to have them dry for months before being sold.\r\n\r\n<ComicSection cols={5} elements={[\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"Those stacks of wood are over 50 feet high!\", position:{col:2, row:1}, size:{width:2, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"It’d be really bad if a fire started here... all of the wood is so.... flammable.\", position:{col:3, row:2}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", alt:\"A brightly colored comic panel showing the inside of a warehouse with large stacks of wood stacked to the ceiling.

The city had engines reporting from seven different stations around the city to come and help, and because the mill was so close to the canal, the city's fireboat was also engaged.\r\n\r\nThe Fireboat Duwamish is part of Seattle's firefighting fleet, and arrives when fires pop up near or on the water. For the Ballard lumber mill fire, it arrived on site from its home at Fire Station 5, located north of Colman Dock in downtown, and fought the fire from the canal.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/fireboat.png\"\r\n    linkout=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0746.photos/?sp=1\"\r\n    caption=\"The Fireboat Duwamish is the 'best preserved' example of an early 20th century fireboat.

A compromise was made, and it was decided that the pool should be built next to McClure Middle School instead.\r\n\r\nEven after it was built, incidents delayed the pool - the humidity turned the exposed bricks white, and the thermometer controlling the pool’s temperature broke, which raised the water to a balmy 100 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the pool was design to match the neighboring middle school, but McAdoo’s modernist touch can be best seen from the interior with its exposed brick, concrete, and wood. \r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"newspaper\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/article.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\"\r\n    caption=\"\"\r\n    alt=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"newspaper\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/tips.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\"\r\n    caption=\"Article from the Hartford Chronicle, an African-American newspaper based in Connecticut, about what it takes to become a architect.

In the wake of MLK’s assassination, Seattle passed Ordinance 96619 to prohibit covenants and sundown zones in the city. \r\n\r\nSeattle has a large Black community, with three large migrations of folks coming to the city in hopes of a good life.

The route that was eventually chosen was the North Canal cut from Shilshole Bay, despite being the longest at 16.9 miles.\r\n\r\nWith a new waterway, there was also a new problem - the city was now divided in half. It was decided that along with carving out the canal and building the locks, four drawbridges should also be constructed to keep the city tied together: the Ballard Bridge, Fremont Bridge, University Bridge, and Montlake Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\r\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The bridge is double-leaf, which means the road divides into two parts when lifted.\"},]}/>\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/doubleLeaf.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=1&st=image\"\r\n    caption=\"\"\r\n    alt=\"\"/>\r\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\r\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"It is also a bascule bridge, which is French for balance - to save energy, the weight of the road-half is perfectly balanced on the other side with a counterweight.\"},]}/>\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bascule.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=3&st=image\"\r\n    caption=\"\"\r\n    alt=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\r\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The Montlake Bridge also uses trunnions, which is the pivot point that the leaves and counterweight rotate around.\"},]}/>\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/trunnion.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=2&st=image\"\r\n    caption=\"\"\r\n    alt=\"\"/>\r\n\r\nThey were inspired by similar bridges in Chicago, designed to cross the Chicago River.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/chicagoBridge.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/stereo.1s12313/\"\r\n    caption=\"Michigan Avenue Bridge over Chicago River\"\r\n    alt=\"stereograph of bridge opening up for a boat to pass under\"/>\r\n\r\nThe first bascule bridge completed was the Fremont Bridge in 1917, and an article about it was published in Engineering News-Record. Folks at the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the firm that had created the trunnion bascule bridge design, saw the article, and in 1920, they sued the city of Seattle for $348,000.\r\n\r\nThe Montlake Bridge was vastly delayed, being the last of the four bridges to be constructed, as the city revised its plans to avoid further litigation. \r\n\r\n<ComicSection elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/protestors.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:4}},\r\n    {type: \"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"I want to see football!!!!\", position:{col:3, row:3}, size:{width:1, height:1}}\r\n]}/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, of all the bascule bridges in the entire city of Seattle, the Montlake Bridge is unique in that the trunnions, the pivot points on which the roads of the bridge turn, sit on top of concrete blocks instead of on steel cross girders. This change was meant to make the bridge different enough from the Strauss design that Strauss wouldn't sue again (they did anyway, in 1925, though they were unable to stop construction).\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge's history and how it works, you can read the full engineering report below, which states: “Only in America could football become a justification for building a bridge.”\r\n\r\n<BigLink link=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0400/wa0441/data/wa0441data.pdf\" thumbnail=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" title=\"Montlake Bridge HAER Report\"/>\r\n\r\n{/* \r\nSticker template: \r\n{image: \"\", linkOut: \"\"}\r\n*/}\r\n\r\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\r\n\r\n]}/>  */}\r\n",

It uses a chemical process that exposes light on a plate coated in silver. Bell was an accomplished daguerreotypist, opening studios across the country, and eventually settling in Seattle.\r\n\r\nAlice Ball was born in 1892 in Seattle, WA into a family of photographers - John Presley Ball was her grandfather - and, perhaps inspired by the photography process, she studied chemistry at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nShe then got her master’s in chemistry at the University of Hawai’i, where her thesis explored the chemical makeup of a plant that could be used to treat many illnesses, from anxiety to kidney disorders.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\r\n\r\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\r\n\r\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\r\n\r\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\r\n\r\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\r\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\r\n\r\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city for these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \r\n\r\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\r\n\r\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\r\n\r\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\r\n\r\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\r\n\r\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \r\n\r\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\r\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\r\n",

Bebb later went on to design the Seattle Asian Art Museum (known at the time as the Art Institute of Seattle).\r\n\r\nAt the time, fire engines were powered by horses, so the back area of the station was a stable.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n    type=\"pnp\"\r\n    image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/firehorse.png\"\r\n    linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a27542/\"\r\n    caption=\"Horse-drawn fire engine rushing to a fire.\"\r\n    alt=\"Photograph shows three white horses rushing down city street pulling a steam fire engine carrying three fire fighters\"/>\r\n<ComicSection elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", alt:\"Brightly colored comic panel showing the front of the Ballard fire station with four large bay doors, against a blue sky with white clouds and birds flying in the distance.\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/station.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:3}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"1rem\"}, src:\"The front the station has four bay doors.\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"2rem\"}, src:\"Perfect for a team of horses on their way to work!\", position:{col:1, row:5}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"image\", alt:\"Brightly colored comic panel showing three determined horses bursting out of one of the fire station’s bay doors, pulling a fire engine with a serious fire fighter sitting atop the engine.\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/horses.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:3, height:7}},\r\n    ]}/>\r\n\r\nAt times, extra support was needed to handle some fires.

This change was meant to make the bridge different enough from the Strauss design that Strauss wouldn't sue again (they did anyway, in 1925, though they were unable to stop construction).\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge's history and how it works, you can read the full engineering report below, which states: “Only in America could football become a justification for building a bridge.”\r\n\r\n<BigLink link=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0400/wa0441/data/wa0441data.pdf\" thumbnail=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" title=\"Montlake Bridge HAER Report\"/>\r\n\r\n{/* \r\nSticker template: \r\n{image: \"\", linkOut: \"\"}\r\n*/}\r\n\r\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\r\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\r\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\r\n\r\n]}/>  */}\r\n","title":"The most unique bridge in Seattle","locationTitle":"Montlake Bridge","address":"Montlake Blvd E","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.64740913305527,-122.30456014763188],"neighborhood":"Montlake","zoom":15,"tags":["built"],"cameraImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bridge.jpg","cardImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bridgeDiagram.png","stampName":null,"photoPrompt":"You can walk over and under the bridge.

Lecturers and students would come across the country to learn at the camp.\r\n\r\n<LOCItem\r\n  type=\"pnp\"\r\n  caption=\"Classroom Building from east\"\r\n  alt=\"black and white photograph of log building\"\r\n  image=\"/loc/sewy/knight/classroom.png\"\r\n  linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wy0048.photos/?sp=13\"/>\r\n\r\nKnight was an ardent educator - in his time, it is estimated that he taught over 13,000 students. And he was disappointed with the amount of fossils that would be extracted from Wyoming and sent out of the state -- so he acquired the Brontosaurus fossils and assembled it for the museum. After his retirement, he kept working, and taught himself metalwork to construct the lifesize T-Rex out of copper plates that sit outside the building named after him.","title":"S.H.
